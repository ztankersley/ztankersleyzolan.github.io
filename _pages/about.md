Hi, my name is Zach Tankersley. Im a passionate and curious product manager focused on solving the right problem for the right market through data-informed decision making. I have run global and co-located agile product teams of various sizes using scrum and kanban methods. I enable teams by helping set up the entire cloud-based software development pipeline with containers and orchestration automation up until the point of actually writing code. I find myself trying to re-train Corporate America how to speak like humans again, and not robots. I specialize in transforming large enterprises with an emphasis in digital transformation. I believe improv comedy and product development are nearly the same thing.
